Technical Specifications
========================

Operation
---------

The *slider* changes between the two clocks. The 5-way button changes the
clock values. The *start/stop* button starts and stops the countdown and
turns of the buzzer. A long press of *start/stop* resets both clocks.

The clocks display a countdown in the format "MM:SS" with MM ranging from
0-99 and seconds from 0-59.


States
------

Possible states:

  - *init*: both clocks show "00:00"
  - *setup*: one digit of the active clock is blinking
  - *ready*: one or both clocks are ready to run
  - *running*: one or both clocks are running
  - *alarm*: the buzzer is ringing


Transitions
-----------

  - *init*    + *set/push*   -> *setup*
  - *setup*   + *set/push*   -> *ready*
  - *setup*   + *left/right* -> *setup* (change digit)
  - *setup*   + *up/down*    -> *setup* (increase/decrease value of digit)
  - *setup*   + *start*      -> *init*
  - *ready*   + *start/stop* -> *running*
  - *running* + *start/stop* -> *ready*
  - *alarm*   + *start/stop* -> *running* (stop buzzer) or *ready*
